## GNU Emacs version 16.56, released July 1985.

This branch is a work in progress to port it to a modern Unix system.
So far `temacs` runs, and seems to work quite well.  It's expected
that dumping a new `emacs` executable will not work due to the messy
unexec facility.

Feel free to dig in and help, but expect the branch to be force-pushed
at any time.
